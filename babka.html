      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <hr>
      <h6>STEP 1: MAKING THE DOUGH</h6>
      <p>
        In a large bowl, whisk together warm water, sugar, salt, and yeast.
        Set it aside for 5 minutes to allow the yeast to activate. Add the softened butter, eggs, and flour,
        then stir until the flour is absorbed and everything is fully combined.
        Remove the dough from the bowl and knead by hand for approximately 8 minutes or until the dough is smooth and no longer lumpy.
        Form the dough into a tight ball place it in a greased or lightly dusted bowl, cover it with a kitchen towel,
        and allow it to rest in a warm spot for about an hour.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 2: MAKING THE FILLING</h6>
      <p>
        In a medium saucepan melt the chocolate, butter, and sugar over medium heat then whisk in the heavy cream, cocoa powder,
        and salt on low heat until completely smooth. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and set aside to cool and thicken up.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 3: SHAPING AND PROOFING</h6>
      <p>
        Transfer the dough to a clean work surface, lightly dusted with flour. Knead and roll out the dough into a rectangle,
        it should be about 1⁄8 – inch thick. Using a spatula, spread the filling over the dough leaving ½ inch border.
        Using both your hands start by slowly rolling it up from the bottom along the longer edge and slightly pulling back to make the roulade as tight as possible.
        Turn the roulade vertically, so one end of it is facing you, using a sharp knife cut the roulade in half lengthwise. Turn the cut side up and twist/braid the strands together,
        while keeping the cut side facing up. Transfer the babka to a greased and dusted loaf pan, cover it with a kitchen towel and allow it to proof for 1 – 1 ½ hours in a warm spot.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 4: BAKE THE BABKAS</h6>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F/175°C and bake for 30 – 45 minutes, until the dough is golden brown, and the chocolate is dark on top.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 5: MAKING THE SYRUP</h6>
      <p>
        In a small saucepan combine the sugar, water, and salt over high heat and bring to a boil. As soon as the sugar dissolves, remove it from the heat and set it aside to cool.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 6: DRIZZLE THE SYRUP</h6>
      <p>
        As soon as the babka comes out of the oven brush or drizzle the syrup over it and allow it to cool in the pan before slicing and serving.
