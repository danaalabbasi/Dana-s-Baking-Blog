      <h6>WHAT IS IT?</h6>
      <p>
        Sourdough bread is the oldest form of leavened bread and first originated in Ancient Egypt;
        it is a slow-fermented bread meaning that it does not need commercial yeast in order to rise.
        It is made with live fermented culture (sourdough starter), which will act as a natural leavening agent.
        Sourdough is famous for its exceptional tangy taste, chewy texture, and crisp, crackly crust.
        If you’re interested in sourdough but don't know where to start, you've come to the right place.
        Here’s everything you need to know about how to make the ideal rustic sourdough bread.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <hr>
      <h6>FOR THE STARTER:</h6>
      <h6>DAY 1</h6>
      <p>
        Combine the whole wheat flour with cool water in a glass or stainless-steel container,
        stir everything together and make sure there is no dry flour anywhere.
        Cover the container and let it sit for 24 hours.
      </p>
      <h6>DAY 2</h6>
      <p>
        You may notice little to no activity in the first 24 hours. In either case,
        discard half of the starter and add 1 cup of all-purpose flour and ½ cup water
        (cool water if your house is warm, or warm water if your house is cool) to the remaining starter.
        Mix well, cover, and let it rest for 24 hours.
      </p>
      <h6>DAY 3</h6>
      <p>
        By now you may have noticed some activity. You’ll now begin two feedings daily,
        for each feeding thoroughly stir your starter and weigh out 113 grams then discard any remaining starter.
        Add 1 cup of all-purpose flour and ½ cup of water to the 113 grams starter.
        Mix, cover, and let it rest for 12 hours before repeating again.
      </p>
      <h6>DAY 4</h6>
      <p>
        Weigh out 113 grams of starter and discard the remaining starter. Add 1 cup of all-purpose flour and ½ cup of water.
        Mix, cover, and let it rest for 12 hours.
      </p>
      <h6>DAY 5</h6>
      <p>
        Weigh out 113 grams of starter and discard the remaining starter.
        Add 1 cup of all-purpose flour and ½ cup of water. Mix, cover, and let it rest for 12 hours.
        By now your starter should have a tangy aroma and has doubled in volume.
        If not repeat discarding and feeding every 12 hours for days 6 and 7 if necessary.
        Once the starter is ready, give it one last feeding then let it sit for 6 – 8 hours.
        Transfer the starter to a glass jar, refrigerate and feed it regularly (watch for a consistent rise of your starter),
        using the normal process.
      </p>
      <h6>FOR THE DOUGH:</h6>
      <h6>STEP 1</h6>
      <p>
        Combine all ingredients together and knead to form a smooth dough.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 2</h6>
      <p>
        In a lightly greased bowl allow the dough to rise, until it has doubled in size.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 3</h6>
      <p>
        Divide the dough into half and shape each half by pulling the edges into the center of the dough,
        flip it over, and gently roll it in your hands to form a ball. Cover and rest the dough for 15 mins.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 4</h6>
      <p>
        Gently roll the dough back and forth to create elongated oval loaves then transfer the loaves to a lined baking sheet.
        Cover and allow it to rise for about an hour.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 5</h6>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 425°F/218°C. Mist/Spray the loaves with warm water and generously dust them with flour.
        Right before the loaves go into the oven using a sharp blade score the dough with diagonal slashes.
      </p>
      <h6>STEP 6</h6>
      <p>
        Bake for 25 – 30 minutes, until deep golden brown. Remove the bread from the oven,
        and cool for at least an hour before slicing.
      </p>
